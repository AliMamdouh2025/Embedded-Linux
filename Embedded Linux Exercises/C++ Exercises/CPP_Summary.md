# C++ Study Summary for Embedded Linux
- This document provides an overview of C++ features with practical examples relevant to embedded Linux programming.


## C++ Input & Output
- C++ provides a streamlined way to handle input and output operations through the standard library.

### Basic Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> x;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << x << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Practical Example for Embedded Linux:

Consider a scenario where your embedded Linux device is interfacing with a UART (serial) port to receive data from a sensor and send it back:

```cpp
#include <iostream>   // Include the I/O stream library for standard input and output operations
#include <fcntl.h>    // Include the file control options for opening the UART device
#include <unistd.h>   // Include the POSIX constants and types for system calls
#include <termios.h>  // Include the terminal I/O library for configuring the UART

int main()
{
    /** Open the UART device at /dev/ttyS0 with read/write access, no controlling terminal, and non-blocking mode
     *
     * The open function is used to open a file or device.
     * 
     *
     * /dev/ttyS0 This is the device file corresponding to the first serial port (UART0) on a Linux system.
     * Serial ports are represented as device files in the /dev directory.
     *
     * O_RDWR: This flag specifies that the device should be opened for both reading and writing. In the context of a UART device, it means you can both send and receive data through this serial        *  port.
     *
     * O_NOCTTY: This flag prevents the terminal from becoming the controlling terminal for the process. If this flag is not set, the device could potentially become the controlling terminal for        * the process, which is generally not desired for a serial communication application.
     *
     * O_NDELAY: This flag opens the device in non-blocking mode. In non-blocking mode, operations on the device will return immediately rather than blocking if no data is available or if the           * device is not ready. For example, reading from the UART device will return immediately with an error code if no data is available, rather than waiting for data to arrive.
     */
    int uart0_filestream = open("/dev/ttyS0", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);

    
    // Check if the UART device was successfully opened
    if (uart0_filestream == -1)
    {
        std::cerr << "Error - Unable to open UART." << std::endl;  // Output error message if failed to open
        return -1;  // Return an error code
    }

    // Configure UART settings
    tcgetattr(uart0_filestream, &options);  // Retrieve the current settings of the UART device
    struct termios options;  // Create a termios structure to hold the configuration options  
    options.c_cflag = B9600 | CS8 | CLOCAL | CREAD; // Set UART options: baud rate of 9600, 8 data bits, Disables control of the terminal by the modem., 1 stop bit, and enable receiver
    options.c_iflag = IGNPAR;  // Ignore parity errors
    options.c_oflag = 0;       // No special output processing
    options.c_lflag = 0;       // No special input processing
    tcflush(uart0_filestream, TCIFLUSH);  // Flush the input buffer to discard any old data
    tcsetattr(uart0_filestream, TCSANOW, &options);  // Apply the new settings immediately

    // Write a message to the UART device
    const char* message = "Hello, UART!";  // Message to be sent via UART
    int count = write(uart0_filestream, message, strlen(message));  // Write the message to UART
    if (count < 0)
    {
        std::cerr << "UART TX error" << std::endl;  // Output error message if writing failed
    }

    // Read data from the UART device
    unsigned char rx_buffer[256];  // Buffer to store incoming data
    int rx_length = read(uart0_filestream, (void*)rx_buffer, 255);  // Read data from UART into buffer
    if (rx_length < 0)
    {
        std::cerr << "UART RX error" << std::endl;  // Output error message if reading failed
    } else if (rx_length == 0)
    {
        std::cout << "No data received" << std::endl;  // Notify if no data was received
    } else
    {
        rx_buffer[rx_length] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the buffer to make it a valid string
        std::cout << "Received: " << rx_buffer << std::endl;  // Output the received data
    }

    close(uart0_filestream);  // Close the UART device
    return 0;  // Return success code
}
```

## C++ Manipulators

Manipulators in C++ are used to modify the formatting of the input/output streams. This is particularly useful when dealing with different data representations, such as hexadecimal or binary, which are common in embedded programming.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main()
{
    int num = 255;
    
    std::cout << "Hexadecimal: " << std::hex << num << std::endl; // Outputs in hexadecimal
    std::cout << "Decimal: " << std::dec << num << std::endl;     // Outputs in decimal
    
    // Reset manipulator after use
    std::cout << std::dec;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Practical Example for Embedded Linux:

Suppose you are working with memory-mapped registers where you need to read and display register values in hexadecimal format:

```cpp
#include <iostream>   // For standard input and output operations
#include <iomanip>    // For input/output manipulators like std::hex
#include <fcntl.h>    // For file control options (e.g., open flags)
#include <unistd.h>   // For POSIX constants and functions (e.g., close, read, write)
#include <sys/mman.h> // For memory management declarations (e.g., mmap, munmap)

// Define the base address for a peripheral register.
// This address should correspond to the specific hardware peripheral you want to interact with.
#define BASE_ADDR        0x3F200000  // Example base address for a peripheral register

int main()
{
   
    // Open /dev/mem for read/write access with synchronization.
    // /dev/mem provides access to physical memory, which is useful for low-level hardware interactions.
    int mem_fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR | O_SYNC);

    if (mem_fd == -1)
    {
        // Print an error message and exit if opening /dev/mem fails.
        std::cerr << "Error opening /dev/mem" << std::endl;
        return -1; // Return with an error code
    }

    // Map a memory region to the process's address space.
    // The size of the region is 4096 bytes (1 page), and the region is mapped with read and write permissions.
    // MAP_SHARED allows changes to the memory to be visible to other processes mapping the same region.
    volatile unsigned int* reg = (unsigned int*)mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, mem_fd, BASE_ADDR);

    if (reg == MAP_FAILED)
    {
        // Print an error message and close the file descriptor if memory mapping fails.
        std::cerr << "Memory mapping failed" << std::endl;
        close(mem_fd); // Close the file descriptor as the memory mapping was not successful
        return -1; // Return with an error code
    }

    // Output the value of the register to the console.
    // std::hex sets the output format to hexadecimal.
    std::cout << "Register value: 0x" << std::hex << *reg << std::endl;

    // Unmap the memory region to release the resources.
    // munmap should be called to clean up after you are done using the mapped memory region.
    munmap((void*)reg, 4096);

    // Close the file descriptor for /dev/mem.
    close(mem_fd);

    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```


## C++ Operators

C++ operators are largely the same as in C, including arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operators. However, C++ introduces additional operators, like the scope resolution operator (`::`), which is essential in object-oriented programming.

### Practical Example for Embedded Linux:

Let's say you need to toggle specific bits in a hardware register for controlling an LED or configuring a peripheral:

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Include the I/O stream library for input and output operations
#include <fcntl.h>   // Include the file control library for file operations
#include <unistd.h>  // Include the POSIX constants and types for system calls

#define BASE_ADDR 0x3F200000  // Define the base address for the peripheral register you want to access
#define LED_BIT 18            // Define the bit position for controlling the LED (example bit position)

int main()
{
    // Open the /dev/mem device file to access physical memory
    // O_RDWR: Open the file descriptor for read and write access
    // O_SYNC: Ensure data is synchronized with the underlying hardware
    int mem_fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR | O_SYNC);

    // Check if the file descriptor was successfully opened
    if (mem_fd == -1)
    {  
        std::cerr << "Error opening /dev/mem" << std::endl;  // Print error message if opening failed
        return -1;  // Return with error code
    }

    // Map the physical memory region to the process's virtual address space
    // NULL: Let the system choose the address where the memory will be mapped
    // 4096: Size of the memory region to map (1 page)
    // PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE: Allow both read and write operations
    // MAP_SHARED: Changes to the memory are visible to other processes mapping the same region
    // mem_fd: File descriptor for /dev/mem
    // BASE_ADDR: Offset into the physical memory to start the mapping
    volatile unsigned int* reg = (unsigned int*)mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, mem_fd, BASE_ADDR);

    // Check if memory mapping was successful
    if (reg == MAP_FAILED)
    {  
        std::cerr << "Memory mapping failed" << std::endl;  // Print error message if mapping failed
        close(mem_fd);  // Close the file descriptor before exiting
        return -1;  // Return with error code
    }

    // Toggle the LED bit by XORing with 1 << LED_BIT
    // XOR operation will flip the bit at the position defined by LED_BIT
    *reg ^= (1 << LED_BIT);  // Modify the register to toggle the LED state

    // Print the register value after the toggle operation
    // std::hex: Output in hexadecimal format
    std::cout << "Register value after toggle: 0x" << std::hex << *reg << std::endl;

    // Unmap the memory region and release resources
    // (void*)reg: Cast the register pointer to void* for munmap
    munmap((void*)reg, 4096);  // Unmap the memory region

    // Close the file descriptor for /dev/mem
    close(mem_fd);  // Release the file descriptor and associated resources

    return 0;  // Return with success code
}
```



## C++ Loops

C++ supports all the traditional loops from C (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) but adds a range-based `for` loop that simplifies iteration over collections like arrays or vectors.

### Range-Based Loop Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 535};

    for (int num : numbers)
    {
        std::cout << num << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```





## C++ Functions

Functions in C++ work similarly to C. Here’s a deeper look into C++ functions, with practical examples that might be useful for embedded systems programming.

## **Basic Function Declaration and Definition**
In C++, functions are declared and defined much like in C. However, C++ allows for default parameters, which can simplify function calls and reduce redundancy in code.

**Basic Function Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function with a default parameter
void printMessage(std::string message = "Hello, World!") {
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    printMessage();            // Prints: Hello, World! (default message)
    printMessage("Hi there!"); // Prints: Hi there! (custom message)
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- The function `printMessage` can be called with or without an argument. If no argument is provided, it uses the default value `"Hello, World!"`.
- This feature is particularly useful in embedded systems where you might want to have default configurations or debug messages that can be overridden as needed.

## **Handling Default Parameters**
One important rule when using default parameters in C++ is that once a default parameter is specified, all subsequent parameters must also have default values.

**Incorrect Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Incorrect function declaration: Missing default value for y
void fun(int x = 2, int y);

void fun(int x, int y)
{
    std::cout << x << " " << y << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    fun(2);  // Error: Function call is ambiguous
    return 0;
}
```
**Why It Fails:**
- The above code will result in a compilation error because `y` is not given a default value, making it impossible to call the function with just one argument.

**Correct Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Correct function declaration with default value for x
void fun(int y, int x = 2);

void fun(int y, int x)
{
    std::cout << x << " " << y << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    fun(3);  // Outputs: 2 3
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- Here, the function `fun` can be called with just one argument (`y`), and `x` will default to `2`. This avoids ambiguity and ensures that the function works as intended.

### **Practical Embedded Linux Examples**
When working with embedded systems, functions with default parameters can be quite powerful. They allow for more readable code and can help in managing hardware configurations.

**Example: Configurable GPIO Setup**
Imagine you’re working with GPIO pins on an embedded Linux device. You might have a function to configure a pin with default settings but allow customization if needed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Function to configure a GPIO pin with default direction and value
void configureGPIO(int pinNumber, std::string direction = "out", int value = 0)
{
    std::cout << "Configuring GPIO Pin: " << pinNumber 
              << " Direction: " << direction 
              << " Value: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    configureGPIO(17);                      // Default: Output, Low
    configureGPIO(18, "in");                // Custom: Input, no value needed
    configureGPIO(22, "out", 1);            // Custom: Output, High
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `configureGPIO` can be called with just a pin number, and it will use default values (`direction = "out"` and `value = 0`).
- This flexibility allows you to easily manage GPIO configurations without repeatedly specifying common settings.

## **Default Parameters and Overloading**
Default parameters can also be combined with function overloading to create even more flexible and powerful interfaces.

**Example: Overloaded GPIO Setup**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Overloaded function to configure a GPIO pin
void configureGPIO(int pinNumber, std::string direction, int value)
{
    std::cout << "Configuring GPIO Pin: " << pinNumber 
              << " Direction: " << direction 
              << " Value: " << value << std::endl;
}

// Overloaded version for input pins without a value parameter
void configureGPIO(int pinNumber, std::string direction = "in")
{
    std::cout << "Configuring GPIO Pin: " << pinNumber 
              << " Direction: " << direction << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    configureGPIO(17, "out", 1);            // Output, High
    configureGPIO(18);                      // Input, default direction
    configureGPIO(22, "out");               // Output, default low value
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- First Call: configureGPIO(17, "out", 1);

This call uses the first overloaded function, passing all three arguments (pinNumber, direction, 
and value). It configures GPIO pin 17 as an output and sets it to high (1).

- Second Call: configureGPIO(18);

This call uses the second overloaded function. It only passes pinNumber, relying on the default value of "in" for direction. It configures GPIO pin 18 as an input.

- Third Call: configureGPIO(22, "out");

This call uses the second overloaded function, passing pinNumber and direction ("out"). Since no value is provided, this assumes a default operation (which could be low or as configured elsewhere in a real system).



Here's an enhanced explanation of function overloading in C++ with practical examples that can be especially useful in embedded Linux programming.

## **Function Overloading in C++**

Function overloading allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists. This is particularly useful when you want to perform similar operations on different types of data. The C++ compiler determines which function to call based on the arguments you provide.

### **Basic Example of Function Overloading**
In the following example, the `print()` function is overloaded to handle different data types:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Overload for integer values
void print(int i)
{
    std::cout << "Integer: " << i << std::endl;
}

// Overload for double (floating-point) values
void print(double f)
{
    std::cout << "Double: " << f << std::endl;
}

// Overload for string values
void print(const std::string &s)
{
    std::cout << "String: " << s << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    print(10);                // Calls the integer overload
    print(3.14);              // Calls the double overload
    print("Hello, World!");   // Calls the string overload
    return 0;
}
```

### **Practical Examples in Embedded Linux**

In embedded systems programming, function overloading can help you simplify the handling of different data types and hardware interfaces.

#### **Example 1: GPIO Control**
Consider controlling GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins, which are crucial in embedded systems for interfacing with peripherals.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Overload to set a GPIO pin to a specific state (high or low)
void setGPIO(int pin, bool state)
{
    std::cout << "Setting GPIO pin " << pin << " to " << (state ? "HIGH" : "LOW") << std::endl;
    // Hardware-specific code to set the pin state
}

// Overload to configure a GPIO pin with direction and initial state
void setGPIO(int pin, const std::string& direction, bool state = false)
{
    std::cout << "Configuring GPIO pin " << pin << " as " << direction 
              << " with initial state " << (state ? "HIGH" : "LOW") << std::endl;
    // Hardware-specific code to configure the pin
}

int main()
{
    setGPIO(17, true);                   // Set GPIO 17 to HIGH
    setGPIO(18, "out", false);           // Configure GPIO 18 as output, set to LOW
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, function overloading simplifies the interface for setting GPIO states and configurations, making the code more readable and maintainable.

#### **Example 2: I2C Communication**
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a protocol commonly used in embedded systems to communicate with sensors and other peripherals.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Overload for reading a single byte from an I2C device
void readI2C(int deviceAddress, int registerAddress)
{
    std::cout << "Reading from device " << deviceAddress 
              << ", register " << registerAddress << std::endl;
    // Hardware-specific code to perform I2C read
}

// Overload for reading multiple bytes from an I2C device
void readI2C(int deviceAddress, int registerAddress, int numBytes)
{
    std::cout << "Reading " << numBytes << " bytes from device " 
              << deviceAddress << ", register " << registerAddress << std::endl;
    // Hardware-specific code to perform I2C read
}

int main()
{
    readI2C(0x48, 0x01);          // Read a single byte
    readI2C(0x48, 0x02, 4);       // Read 4 bytes
    return 0;
}
```

## **Ambiguous Function Calls**
Function overloading can sometimes lead to ambiguous function calls if the compiler cannot determine which function to use. Consider the following:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Overload with int and default int parameter
void fun(int x, int y = 3)
{
    std::cout << x << " " << y << std::endl;
}

// Overload with int and default float parameter
void fun(int x, float y = 3.0f)
{
    std::cout << x << " " << y << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    fun(2);  // Ambiguous call: the compiler cannot decide which overload to use
    return 0;
}
```

This code results in a compilation error because the call to `fun(2)` matches both overloads (`int` with `int` or `float` default). To resolve such ambiguities, you can explicitly specify the argument type, or adjust your overloads to be more distinct.

## **Name Mangling**

C++ allows function overloading by using **name mangling**, a process where the compiler generates unique names for each function based on its parameters. This ensures that even though the functions have the same name in your source code, they have distinct names in the compiled binary.

#### **Example:**
Suppose you have the following overloaded functions:

```cpp
void fun(int x);
void fun(double x);
```

These might be "mangled" into names like `_Z3funi` for the `int` version and `_Z3fund` for the `double` version (exact names depend on the compiler).

#### **Demangling:**
You can view and demangle these names using tools like `c++filt`:

- **View Mangled Names:**
  ```bash
  objdump -t your_binary | grep fun
  ```
- **Demangle a Name:**
  ```bash
  c++filt _Z3funi
  ```

This command will return the original function signature.




## Arrays in Modern C++
In modern C++, arrays are an essential tool for handling collections of elements. The traditional C-style arrays (`int arr[5]`) remain available but are complemented by safer and more flexible alternatives like `std::array` and `std::vector` from the Standard Template Library (STL).

#### **Modern C++: `std::array`**
- Safer and more feature-rich alternative to C-style arrays.
- Compile-time fixed size.
- Provides bounds checking with `.at()` and integrates seamlessly with STL algorithms.

1. **Declaration and Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   std::array<int, 6> numbers = {2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18};
   ```
2. **Accessing Elements**:
   - **With Indices**:
     ```cpp
     for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i)
     {
         std::cout << numbers[i] << " ";
     }
     ```
   - **With Range-Based Loop**:
     ```cpp
     for (int value : numbers)
     {
         std::cout << value << " ";
     }
     ```
   - **Safe Access**:
     ```cpp
     std::cout << numbers.at(3); // Bounds-checked access
     ```

---

#### **Dynamic Arrays: `std::vector`**
- For variable-sized collections.
- Handles memory allocation and resizing automatically.
1. **Declaration and Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   std::vector<int> numbers = {2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18};
   numbers.push_back(20); // Add a new element
   ```
2. **Accessing Elements**:
   - Similar to `std::array`.

---

### Example: Arrays in Adaptive AUTOSAR
Let’s simulate a scenario in **Adaptive AUTOSAR** where an array is used to manage diagnostic event IDs.

---

#### Scenario:
- A `std::array` holds predefined diagnostic event IDs (fixed size).
- A `std::vector` dynamically stores active diagnostic events.
- Use range-based loops for processing.

---

#### Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Diagnostic Event Manager Simulation
class DiagnosticEventManager
{
private:
    // Fixed set of predefined diagnostic event IDs
    std::array<int, 5> predefinedEvents = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005};
    // Active diagnostic events (dynamic size)
    std::vector<int> activeEvents;

public:
    // Initialize active events with some IDs
    void initializeActiveEvents()
    {
        activeEvents.push_back(1001);
        activeEvents.push_back(1004);
    }

    // Print predefined events
    void displayPredefinedEvents() const
    {
        std::cout << "Predefined Diagnostic Events:\n";
        for (const auto& event : predefinedEvents)
        {
            std::cout << "Event ID: " << event << "\n";
        }
     }

    // Print active events
    void displayActiveEvents() const
   {
        std::cout << "Active Diagnostic Events:\n";
        for (const auto& event : activeEvents)
        {
            std::cout << "Event ID: " << event << "\n";
        }
    }

    // Check if an event is active
    bool isEventActive(int eventID) const
   {
        for (const auto& event : activeEvents)
        {
            if (event == eventID)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Activate a new event
    void activateEvent(int eventID)
   {
        if (!isEventActive(eventID))

## Threads in Embedded Linux

In an embedded Linux environment, applications often use threading to perform tasks concurrently, such as handling hardware communication while also maintaining a responsive user interface. Threads enable parallel execution, improving system performance and responsiveness.

#### Example with Threads

```cpp
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>

void fun()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::thread t(fun);  // Start a thread t to run the fun() function
    return 0;
}
```

#### What Happens Here?
- **Main Thread Exits First**: The program starts the thread `t` to run the `fun` function. However, the main thread (which started the program) terminates immediately after starting the thread. The thread `t` may still be running, but once the main thread exits, the entire program terminates, potentially before the thread has completed.
  
- **Embedded Linux Example**: Consider an embedded system where you launch a thread to blink an LED. If the main thread exits too soon, the LED may never blink, causing unexpected behavior.

- **Core Dump (Crash)**: When the main thread exits, the operating system may forcibly terminate any running threads, which can result in a core dump (i.e., program crash).

#### Solution: `join`

To prevent premature termination of the program, we can use `join`, which ensures that the main thread waits for the thread `t` to finish its task.

```cpp
int main()
{
    std::thread t(fun);  // Start thread t
    t.join();  // Main thread waits for thread t to finish
    return 0;
}
```

- **Blocking Call**: `t.join()` is a blocking call, meaning the main thread will stop and wait for the thread `t` to complete execution. In embedded systems, this ensures that critical tasks, like sensor data processing or hardware initialization, are completed before the program exits.

#### Embedded Linux Example:
In an embedded system, you might create a thread for reading sensor data from a GPIO pin. The main thread will wait (block) for the sensor-reading thread to finish its task before terminating the program, ensuring that no data is missed or partially processed.

```cpp
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

void readSensor()
{
    sleep(2);  // Simulate sensor reading delay
    std::cout << "Sensor data read" << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::thread sensorThread(readSensor);
    sensorThread.join();  // Wait for sensorThread to complete
    std::cout << "Main thread: Sensor data processing complete" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Detaching a Thread: `detach`

In some cases, you may want the thread to run independently without waiting for it to finish. This is where `detach` comes in.

```cpp
int main()
{
    std::thread t(fun);  // Start thread t
    t.detach();  // Allow thread t to run independently
    return 0;
}
```

- **Non-blocking**: Once a thread is detached, the main thread will continue its execution without waiting for the detached thread. The detached thread runs independently, and you lose control over it—no way to know when it finishes or if it finishes.

- **Risk**: In an embedded Linux system, if the main thread exits too soon, the detached thread may not have enough time to complete its work. For example, if the main thread terminates while a thread is writing to a log file, the log might be incomplete.

#### Embedded Linux Example:
Consider an application in an embedded system where you want to log some debug data to a file in the background while the main thread continues to process other tasks.

```cpp
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unistd.h>

void logData()
{
    sleep(1);  // Simulate time-consuming logging
    std::ofstream logfile("log.txt", std::ios::app);
    logfile << "Logging sensor data...\n";
    logfile.close();
    std::cout << "Log complete" << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::thread logThread(logData);
    logThread.detach();  // Allow logging to run in the background
    std::cout << "Main thread continues without waiting for log" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- **Outcome**: The main thread will not wait for the logging to finish. The output of the program may differ depending on the timing, and sometimes the program might terminate before the logging is done.
